"Bridging the Gap Between Surplus Food & Zero Hunger"

Project Overview:
MealBridge is a hyperlocal platform designed for the SRM Ramapuram campus to tackle food wastage in messes and canteens. It provides a real-time bridge between food donors (messes/canteens) and recipients (students/NGOs).

The Problem
->Campus canteens and messes often discard kgs of edible food daily.
->There is no structured way for students or nearby NGOs to access this surplus food efficiently.

Our Solution
->Real-time Listings: Donors can post surplus food details in under 30 seconds.
->Instant Claiming: A "First-Come, First-Served" system to ensure food is reserved immediately.

Gamification (Green Badges): Incentivizing donors with ranking points to encourage consistent participation.
